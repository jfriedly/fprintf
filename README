My first README file!

This program parses your code and adds in an fprintf statement everywhere you have a
printf statement.  Intended for OSU FEH students in ENG 192 that are getting
annoyed at always having to copy and paste their printf statements so that the
program will print to the screen and an output file.  Still needs work:
indenting -- I'm trying to make it auto indent the statements properly too.
